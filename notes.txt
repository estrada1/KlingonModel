GeckoImpact
- March 2015 
- Preliminary model of rigid body impacting wall 
- Trying to reproduce rolling behavior, but a single rigid body didn't seem to cut it

TwoBodyCollision
- July 8, 2015 
- Using MG as a symbolic manipulator for an analytical solution
- Two link rigid-body sticks inelastically to the wall at the point of contact
- Throw symbolic solution into Matlab (and change some notation to make it compatible) to plot kinetic energy lost and impulse in different directions

BerkeleyImpact_DropTest
- July 2015 
- Matching this stuff up to ATI drop test data 
- Still had tail attached 

BerkeleyImpact_PerchTest 
- August 2015 
- Model of Klingon 2.0 used to match to force data in 2D now 

BerkeleyImpact_LongBody
- Sept 23 2015
- Added x_Ccm, y_Ccm
- Tail recessed down below landing gear as we had proposed months ago
- Tried to get some linear damping to reduce forces with the tail, but I think the mass is way too small to have any significant effect. 

BerkeleyImpact_TallBody
- Sept 24 2015 
- Giving a long 'nose', or extension up above the landing gear
- Tail mounted directly behind landing gear again
- Idea is to use the tail for rotational resistance rather than linear. Take advantage of the long lever arm there.
